# Gmail Setup

This is optional and will send you all messages you would get by using the Slack/Telegram/Sendgrid integration.
To add this functionality 
these steps are needed:
1. Create a gmail Account
2. Create an app-password 
3. Fill in the config.properties

### 1. Create an account
Open this https://accounts.google.com/signup and create an account.

### 2. Create an app-password 

Open this https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and create an app-password.  
Copy the app-password now as you will not be able to access it later, you can always create a new one though.

### 3. Fill in the config.properties

Fill in all gmail fields in the [config.properties](/src/main/resources/config.properties) and you're done
